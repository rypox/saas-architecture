# Systems concept

## Setup process

### Prompt

Create a plan on how to create kubernetes on-premise cluster where the saas can be deployed. Name the kubernetes software components to use. Focus on the design of the software components and services in the Kubernetes cluster where the nodes are already provisioned and the basic kubernetes installation (rke2) is already done. Also get ideas from sap gardener or similar projects.

### Plan

To create an on-premise Kubernetes cluster for deploying your SaaS application, we'll focus on the design of software components and services, assuming the nodes are already provisioned and the basic Kubernetes installation (RKE2) is complete. Here's a plan for setting up the cluster with necessary components:

## Core Kubernetes Components

1. Control Plane:
    - etcd: Distributed key-value store for cluster data
    - kube-apiserver: API server for cluster management
    - kube-controller-manager: Manages controller processes
    - kube-scheduler: Assigns pods to nodes

2. Worker Nodes:
    - kubelet: Ensures containers are running in a pod
    - kube-proxy: Manages network rules on nodes

## Additional Components and Services

### Networking

- Calico: For network policy and pod networking[8]
- MetalLB: Load balancer for bare-metal Kubernetes clusters

### Storage

- Rook: Cloud-native storage orchestrator for Kubernetes
- Ceph: Distributed storage system (managed by Rook)

### Ingress and API Gateway

- Ingress-NGINX: Kubernetes ingress controller
- Kong: API Gateway for routing and authentication

### Monitoring and Logging

- Prometheus: Metrics collection and alerting
- Grafana: Visualization and dashboards
- Elasticsearch, Fluentd, Kibana (EFK Stack): Log aggregation and analysis

### Security

- Cert-Manager: Automate certificate management
- Vault (HashiCorp): Secrets management
- Trivy: Container vulnerability scanner

### CI/CD

- ArgoCD: GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes

### Service Mesh

- Istio: Advanced traffic management, security, and observability

### Cluster Management

- Rancher: Multi-cluster management and operations[6]

## Implementation Plan

1. Set up core networking with Calico and MetalLB
2. Deploy storage solution using Rook with Ceph
3. Install and configure Ingress-NGINX and Kong API Gateway
4. Set up monitoring and logging stack (Prometheus, Grafana, EFK)
5. Implement security measures with Cert-Manager, Vault, and Trivy
6. Deploy ArgoCD for continuous delivery
7. Install Istio service mesh
8. Configure Rancher for cluster management

## High Availability Considerations

- Deploy at least three control plane nodes for quorum[1]
- Use a dedicated HAProxy load balancer for the API server[1]
- Implement multi-master setup for production environments[1]
- Configure etcd for high availability with at least three nodes[1]

## Best Practices

- Separate control plane and worker nodes[5]
- Use SSDs for etcd storage to improve performance[1]
- Implement proper network segmentation and security policies
- Regularly update and patch all components
- Use namespaces to organize and isolate resources
- Implement resource quotas and limits

By following this plan and incorporating these components, you'll have a robust, scalable, and secure on-premise Kubernetes cluster ready for deploying your SaaS application. The design takes inspiration from enterprise-grade solutions like SAP Gardener, focusing on scalability, security, and manageability.

## cluster components

### Prompt

put all the software components in "Additional components and services" into a table with a short description and additional columns for sizing,scaling recommendations, three popular alternatives to the current software component, order the table according to the implementation plan.

### Cluster Components

| Component | Description | Sizing/Scaling Recommendations | Alternatives |
|-----------|-------------|--------------------------------|--------------|
| Calico | Network policy and pod networking | Scale with cluster size; typically lightweight | Cilium, Flannel, Weave Net |
| MetalLB | Load balancer for bare-metal Kubernetes clusters | Depends on number of services; start small and scale as needed | kube-vip, Porter, OpenELB |
| Rook | Cloud-native storage orchestrator | Scale based on storage needs; start with 3 nodes for high availability | OpenEBS, Longhorn, Portworx |
| Ceph | Distributed storage system managed by Rook | Scale horizontally by adding more nodes; start with at least 3 nodes | GlusterFS, MinIO, NFS |
| Ingress-NGINX | Kubernetes ingress controller | Scale based on incoming traffic; use HPA for automatic scaling | Traefik, HAProxy, Istio Ingress |
| Kong | API Gateway for routing and authentication | Scale based on API traffic; use HPA for automatic scaling | Traefik, Ambassador, Gloo |
| Prometheus | Metrics collection and alerting | Scale with cluster size; use federation for large clusters | Thanos, Victoria Metrics, Cortex |
| Grafana | Visualization and dashboards | Typically lightweight; scale based on concurrent users | Kibana, Chronograf, Redash |
| Elasticsearch | Log storage and search engine | Scale horizontally; start with 3 nodes, add as log volume increases | OpenSearch, Loki, Splunk |
| Fluentd | Log collection and forwarding | Deploy as DaemonSet; scales automatically with nodes | Logstash, Vector, Fluent Bit |
| Kibana | Log visualization | Typically lightweight; scale based on concurrent users | Grafana Loki, Graylog, Splunk |
| Cert-Manager | Automate certificate management | Lightweight; scales with number of certificates | Let's Encrypt, HashiCorp Vault PKI |
| Vault | Secrets management | Start with 3 nodes for high availability; scale based on secrets volume | AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, Sealed Secrets |
| Trivy | Container vulnerability scanner | Typically lightweight; scale based on scanning frequency | Clair, Anchore, Snyk |
| ArgoCD | GitOps continuous delivery tool | Scale based on number of applications; start small and increase as needed | Flux, Jenkins X, Spinnaker |
| Istio | Service mesh for traffic management, security, and observability | Scale with cluster size; consider performance impact | Linkerd, Consul, Kuma |
| Rancher | Multi-cluster management and operations | Scale based on number of managed clusters; start with 3 nodes for high availability | OpenShift, Tanzu Mission Control, Google Anthos |

This table provides an overview of the additional components and services, their descriptions, sizing and scaling recommendations, and alternatives. The components are ordered according to the implementation plan, starting with networking and storage, followed by ingress and API management, monitoring and logging, security, CI/CD, service mesh, and finally cluster management[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9].
